          <h1><span>Sierra Meadow</span></h1>
          <p>In 1930, Ansel Adams ventured to Yosemite’s high country and photographed “Sierra Meadow,” a work of art that depicts the lush beauty and intricate flora of a garden-meadow. The wildflowers in Ansel’s photograph glow with a luminosity made through a soft focus lens, a technique Ansel almost entirely abandoned five years earlier. Though “Sierra Meadow” does not illustrate the high contrast and sharper style of Ansel’s more well known photographs, it was a piece that remained close to his heart for the rest of his life.</p>

As the oldest of the Honolulu Botanical Gardens, Foster Garden displays a mature and impressive collection of tropical plants. Some of the magnificent trees in this 14-acre garden were planted in the 1850s by Dr. William Hillebrand. They marked the beginning of a heritage that became The Honolulu Botanical Gardens.</p>

          <p>While returning from an unsuccessful trip to Canyon de Chelly in search of a color photograph for Kodak, Adams happened upon this grove of aspens. "We were in the shadow of the mountains, " Adams wrote, "the light was cool and quiet and no wind was stirring. The aspen trunks were slightly greenish and the leaves were a vibrant yellow....I made the horizontal picture first, the moved to the left and made the vertical image at about the same subject distance. The few yellow leaves seen in the vertical image were not as bright as those in the horizontal version....The majority of viewers of the horizontal image think it was a sunlit scene. When I explain that it is represented diffused lighting from the sky and also reflected light from the distant clouds, some rejoin 'Then why does it look the way it does?' Such questions remind me that many viewers expect a photograph to be a the literal simulation of reality."</p>

Wherever you live along the Pacific coast and whatever it's called where you are, it's the same tree: Arbutus menziesii, with leathery evergreen leaves, red bark peeling from a tan trunk, whitish flowers and bright clusters of reddish-orange berries. This photo focuses on the peeling bark, a key feature of the plant that is so strongly identified with the area and held with great affection by locals.</p>

          <p>Perched atop Sentinel Dome, weathered by wind, rain, and snow, this Jeffrey Pine provides a dramatic form that has made it one of the single most photographed trees in the world. Carleton Watkins photographed the tree in 1867, and generations of visitors to Yosemite photographed it until it finally collapsed in 2003. This image, made in 1940, is a dramatic composition in which the foreground and background are contributing elements that enhance the form of the tree.</p>

          <h1><span>Oak Tree, Snowstorm</span></h1>
          <p>Ansel Adams made this image in 1948 using an 8" x 10" view camera. This towering oak at the western fringe of El Capitan Meadow was among his favorite subjects. Since Adams first photographed the tree, age has taken its toll and it succumbed to fire in recent years. However, the towering cliffs between Bridalveil Fall and Cathedral Spires that lurk in the mists behind the oak in this photograph remain as solid as ever. The Sierra Club published "Oak Tree, Snowstorm" in 1948, along with 11 other photographs by Ansel Adams, in "Portfolio I." Later, Adams selected it for his Museum Set Collection, a retrospective portfolio of what he considered his strongest work, and it appeared in "Classic Images," the book based on the Museum Set. The image is one of Adams' icons, and has also been published in Ansel Adams Monograph (out of print), the Portfolios of Ansel Adams, Yosemite and the High Sierra, and Yosemite.</p>

          <h1><span>Dogwood Blossoms</span></h1>
          <p>Ansel Adams made this image with a 5" x 7" view camera in 1938, the year he trekked through the high sierra with Edward Weston. Depending upon the year, dogwoods typically peak during April or May in Yosemite , evoking bursts of starlight against the bare forest backdrop. This dramatic contrast prompted Adams to compose one of his only still-life images. To capture the 12 blossoms in this spectacular spray of dogwoods, he placed them atop a nearby rock covered with pine needles and lichen. <br><br>

            The Sierra Club published "Dogwood Blossoms" in 1960 after Ansel Adams selected it, along with 15 other images, for inclusion in "Portfolio III, Yosemite Valley ." Later, Adams selected it for his Museum Set Collection, a retrospective portfolio of what he considered his strongest work. The image has been published in Classic Images , the book based on the Museum Set, Yosemite and the Range of Light (out of print) , Yosemite, The Portfolios of Ansel Adams, Yosemite and the High Sierra, and Ansel Adams Monograph (out of print)</p>
