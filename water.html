It was one of the rare cloudless days of that summer. Adams and his son Michael spent a week in the ranger station waiting for the right conditions. The image was ultimately captured with his trusty 8x10 camera at 1:30 in the morning.</p>

          <p>One of Ansel's last battles on the conservation front was to create a “Big Sur National Park” to protect this spectacular coast for all generations. While not successful during his lifetime, there is now an virtually contiguous area of protected lands from Carmel to south of Lucia. The foresight that Ansel had to value the area and try to protect it from over-development was instrumental to getting the ball rolling. Thankfully today the view from this spot is not different.</p>

          <p>Ansel Adams made this image in approximately 1936 with a 3 1/4" x 4 1/4" Zeiss Jewel view camera. He took the photograph from the east side the fall, setting up his camera on Fern Ledge, a precariously narrow trail exposed to gusting winds and blowing mist from the nearby fall. In this image, Yosemite Fall dominates the space of the picture. Adams used this visualization motif of filling the photograph with his subject in many images he made during the 1930s, notably " Nevada Fall, Yosemite Valley ." That image was one of ten he selected for the Group f/64 Exhibition at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in 1932, alongside photographs by Edward Weston and Imogene Cunningham. Ansel Adams braved the steep, slippery climb to Yosemite Fall again in 1946 when he made the color image published in Ansel Adams: In Color. <span>"Yosemite Fall, Profile" appears in Yosemite and the High Sierra and Yosemite and the Range of Light."</span></p>

          <p>Ansel Adams made this image around 1949 using an 8" x 10" view camera, developing it with a projection enlarger rather than as a contact print. He made the image in the spring when the Merced River floods the meadows of this often-overlooked part of western Yosemite Valley; behind the rocks on the right is Bridalveil Fall, and El Capitan looms just to the left. Adams knew that evaporation clouds from high sierra snowmelt often built in the spring. He waited for these conditions and the low-angle afternoon sun to create the dramatic lighting effect he sought for this photograph.</p>

          <h1><span>El Capitan, Merced River, Clouds</span></h1>
          <p>Ansel Adams made this image around 1952 with an 8" x 10" view camera facing east upstream the Merced River. The rushing water and streaks of sunlight cutting through the billowing clouds create a sense of movement and velocity in the photograph. The river's rapids reveal the location of the terminal moraine of the last glacier to fill Yosemite Valley; in other, west-facing images of the El Capitan, the surface of the Merced lies placid above this natural dam. During his career, Adams took many images of El Capitan's dramatic face, notably one of his first known photographs taken in 1916 on his first trip to Yosemite . Using a Kodak #1 Box Brownie, he offered an early hint at the visualization that would later become his hallmark, framing the pale granite face that with leafy trees in the foreground to downplay the overwhelming size of El Capitan. Source ? After that early photograph, Ansel Adams returned to El Capitan over and again photographing it in every time, season, and light he could.

          <h5>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</h5>
          <h1><span>Bridalveil Fall</span></h1>
          <p>Ansel Adams made this image with a 6 1/2" x 8 1/2" Korona view camera and a glass plate negative around 1927. The image captures Yosemite 's majestic Bridalveil Fall, including the curling mist that inspired its Native American name pohono , meaning “puff of wind.” The fall looms large in family lore: in 1901, Harry and Anne Best, the parents of Ansel's wife Virginia, were married at its base. "Bridalveil Fall" is emblematic of the images Adams made during the late 1920s, a critical development period in his career.
            <br><br>
            During this time, he asserted control of the photographic process by accentuating and minimizing different aspects of his images, a process he called visualization. Adams discussed visualization in "Modern Photography 1934-35: The Studio Annual of Camera Art," writing that before exposing the negative, "The photographer visualizes his conception of the subject as present in the final print." His friend Francis Farquhar described Adams ' brilliance at visualization in a 1931 article for Touring Topics: "It is the artist's genius which enables him to perceive at once the arrangement of masses, the flow of lines, and the texture of surfaces in the object of vision, whether it be a mountain, a landscape, a building, a cloud, a tree, a human form or face, or anything whatsoever." Adams emerged from the 1920s with a new vision of his role as an artist and abandoned his ambition to become a concert pianist. "Bridalveil Fall" appeared in Sierra Nevada: the John Muir Trail , Yosemite and the Range of Light , (out of print), Yosemite and the High Sierra , Yosemite , and "Classic Images," the book based on the Museum Set, a retrospective portfolio of what Adams considered his strongest work.

          <h5>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</h5>
          <h1><span>Vernal Fall</span></h1>
          <p>Ansel Adams made this image around 1948 with a 4" x 5" view camera. The hike up the Mist Trail to Vernal Fall is short, accessible, and heavily trafficked. John Muir, in his book "The Yosemite," described the fall: "The Vernal, about a mile below the Nevada, is 400 feet high, a staid, orderly, graceful, easy-going fall, proper and exact in every movement and gesture …it is a favorite with most visitors, doubtless because it is more accessible than any other, more closely approached and better seen and heard. A good stairway ascends the cliff beside it and the level plateau at the head enables one to saunter safely along the edge of the river as it comes from Emerald Pool and to watch its waters, calmly bending over the brow of the precipice, in a sheet eighty feet wide, changing in color from green to purplish gray and white until dashed on a boulder talus." The Mist Trail is notoriously wet -- standing in the rain can be drier. Adams would have faced challenges keeping his equipment dry while capturing this familiar icon of Yosemite. <br><br>

            "Vernal Fall" appeared "Portfolio IV, What Majestic Word," published by the Sierra Club in 1963 and Classic Images, the book based on the Museum Set Collection, a retrospective portfolio of what Adams considered his strongest work. It has also been published in Yosemite and the Range of Light (out of print), Yosemite, and the Portfolios of Ansel Adams.</p>
