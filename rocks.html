          <p>The photo of Mount McKinley with Wonder Lake in the foreground was taken in the summer while Adams was in Alaska on a Guggenheim Fellowship trip. It was one of the rare cloudless days of that summer. Adams and his son Michael spent a week in the ranger station waiting for the right conditions. The image was ultimately captured with his trusty 8x10 camera at 1:30 in the morning.</p>

          <h1><span>Monolith, The Face of Half Dome</span></h1>
          <p>On the chilly spring morning of April 10th, 1927, Ansel Adams set out along Yosemite’s LeConte Gully to capture an image of the striking sheer face of Half Dome, one of Yosemite National Park’s most iconic natural features. Though Ansel knew the route well, having spent four teenage summers as the keeper of the Sierra Club’s nearby lodge in Yosemite Valley, his companions—his fiancée Virginia Best and three close friends, including his lifetime friend and fellow wilderness photographer Cedric Wright—picked carefully along the steep gully in the icy shadow of nearby Grizzly Peak.</p>

          <h1><span>Cathedral Peak and Lake</span></h1>
          <p>The story behind Ansel Adams’ “Cathedral Peak and Lake” brings us back to the long friendship formed between Ansel and renowned artist Georgia O’Keeffe. Perhaps no two artists have had a greater impact on the cultural imagination of America’s wilderness. Though Ansel’s medium was photography while O’Keeffe’s was painting, both, in their own way, captured the style, emotion, and drama of exploring the landscapes of America. It’s no surprise that they were not only great admirers of each other’s artistic works, but close friends and frequent companions. This photo was taken during their journey through Yosemite National Park.</p>

          <h1><span>Moon and Half Dome</span></h1>
          <p>Ansel Adams made this image at 4:14 the afternoon of December 28, 1960 with a Hasselblad camera and 250mm Zeiss Sonnar lens, releasing the mirror before operating the shutter to minimize vibration. It was one of his last well known photographs. Arguably, this is the definitive photograph of Half Dome and among the most famous images of Yosemite National Park . Belying its later worldwide acclaim, "Moon and Half Dome" debuted for a very personal audience: the first publication of this masterpiece was as the wedding announcement for Adams ' son, Michael, and his daughter-in-law, Jeanne in 1962. In "Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs," Adams recalls making "Moon and Half Dome:" "As soon as I saw the moon coming up by Half Dome I had visualized the image. …I have photographed Half Dome innumerable times, but it is never the same Half Dome, never the same light or the same mood. …Half Dome is a great mountain with endless variations of lighting and sky situations and seasonal characteristics; the many images I have made reflect my varied creative responses to this remarkable granite monolith."</p>

          <p>On his first trip to Canyon de Chelly in September 1937, Ansel was drawn to the "beautiful, flowing patterns" of the dunes clearly visible in the lower left corner of this photograph. He wrote to his wife, Virginia, "The Canyon de Chelly exceeds anything I have imagined at any time!"</p>

          <p>On four successive mornings Adams tried to take this photograph from the east side of the Sierra. On the fifth day it was still dark and bitterly cold when he set up his camera on the new platform on top of his car and retreated to the warm interior. As dawn drew near, he returned to the camera to await the sun's first rays on the meadow. "I finally encountered the bright, glistening sunrise with light clouds streaming from the southeast and casting swift moving shadows on the meadow and dark rolling hills." At the last possible moment, the horse turn to offer a profile view. Many years later he wrote "Sometimes I think I do get to places just when God's ready to have somebody click the shutter!"</p>

          <p>Ansel Adams made this image around 1952 with an 8" x 10" view camera. El Capitan is the largest exposed granite face in the world, drawing climbers from around the globe. Thanks to Adams' work, it's also a magnet for photographers and this image has long been a favorite of the Adams family. During his career, he took many images of El Capitan's dramatic face, notably one of his first known photographs taken in 1916 on his first trip to Yosemite . Using a Kodak #1 Box Brownie, he offered an early hint at the visualization that would later become his hallmark, framing the pale granite face with leafy trees in the foreground to downplay the overwhelming size of El Capitan. After that early photograph, Ansel Adams returned to El Capitan over and again photographing it in every time, season, and light he could. This version appears in Yosemite .</p>

          <p>Perched atop Sentinel Dome, weathered by wind, rain, and snow, this Jeffrey Pine provides a dramatic form that has made it one of the single most photographed trees in the world. Carleton Watkins photographed the tree in 1867, and generations of visitors to Yosemite photographed it until it finally collapsed in 2003. This image, made in 1940, is a dramatic composition in which the foreground and background are contributing elements that enhance the form of the tree.</p>
